Kargo Intern First Round

Problem
Determine whether a one-to-one character mapping exists from one string, s1, to another string,
s2.
For example, given s1 = abc and s2 = bcd, print "true" into stdout since we can map each
character in "abc" to a character in "bcd".
Given s1 = foo and s2 = bar, print "false" since the character ‘o’ cannot map to two characters.
But given s1 = bar and s2 = foo, print "true" since each character in "bar" can be mapped to a
character in "foo".


Entire code is in one file main.java

Compile it using "javac main.java"

Run it as "java main foo bar"

The program accepts two arguments s1 and s2.

The program prints back true if there exists a one to one character mapping from s1 to s2
and prints false if there does not exist a one to one character mapping from s2 to s2.
